# FaceMaskDetection
* Repo contains two .ipynb notebooks 
  #### 1.Face_Mask_detector_for_Covid_19 : 
    Notebook contains Code for Data Preprocessing and Training using Face Detector Model built from scratch using Keras 
  #### 2.Face_mask_detection_using_MobileNetV2.
    Notebook Contains Code for Data Preprocessing and Training using Finetuned MobileNetV2 model pretrained on imagenet dataset for face mask detection
    
 Results and Accuracy of **Face_Mask_detector_for_Covid_19** Notebook is discussed below:
    
 Face Mask Detector is built using multi-step approach by extracting face of person using HaarCascades & passing it to mask detection model
  
 ### Architecture of mask detection model
